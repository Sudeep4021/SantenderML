I work on a dataset which helps to understand customers financial status and try to improve our banking services to
match our customers needs and there goals. 

I worked on the challenge and try to solve by using modern day's machine learning algorithms, while working with the data
I target accuracy, Precision and F1 Score to bring out the perfect answer. As It was a classification problem 
(i.e., Yes or no), we are tyring to predict whether our Customer is satisfied or not? Will a customer but this product?
or can a customer pay the loans?. 

To handle the Challenge we try some technique like checking the Missing value and Performing feature engineering,
and reduce the irrelevant features. And we applied different algorithmns, but random forest classifier was the 
best fit according to cross validation technique and AUC ROC Curve.

So lastly, Random Forest algorithms with additional features will improve and solve the real world problem. And
further I can improve the model for better results. But for now it is pretty much better to counter the challenge.
